# 2023-01; First blog post with markdown

:::tip Summary

****

:::

## Headings

Headings are controlled by prefixing the text with `#`. A single `#` is called an H1, meaning the top heading of the page. H2 and H3 appears in the docusaurus side bars. H4, (`####`) and H5 (`#####`) are even smaller headings and don't appear in docusaurus navigational elements in this site.

## Bold

Items wrapped with `**` are **bold**.

## Italics

Items wrapped with `_` are _italicized_.

## List

### Unordered list

- What
- a 
- great 
  - awesome
  - thrilling
- idea

### Ordered list

1. Start with 1
1. Then go to 2. 
1. Wait, how is the numbering increasing? The raw markdown shows only `1.` but markdown knows to increase the numbering.
