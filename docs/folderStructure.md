# Docusaurus folder structure

The three important folders you use are:

* **docs** - to add documentation or non-timestamped information to your site
    * all associated images should go in a subdirectory named `media`
* **blog** - to add timestamped information - blogs are shown from most-recent to oldest
    * all associated images should go in a subdirectory named `media`
* **static/img** - images for site branding and navigation elements
    * an example is the web page favorite icon displays in the browser tab, `favicon.ico`
